        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>To build revenue and share information regarding our white water rafting trips. I want it to be easier for anyone interested in our trips to get all the information they need including prices, trip availability, what to pack, safety tips, and complete the safety waiver.</p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            This information is for anyone looking to be introduced to the wonderful world of white water rafting. We are mainly focussed on beginner rafters or those who have little to no experience rafting. This could be anyone from a family with kids or a team building trip for teens or business people. The needs that aren't being met in regards to building this website is that anyone looking to book a trip must call in to get all the necessary information. This website will provide all the information as well contact info in case anyone would still like to speak with an employee. My audience will usually access my site from many different devices including mobile and desktop-- which means the site needs to be responsive to most screen types.
