            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Kendra. My husband, Nathan, and I have been married for just over 4 years. We have a 16 month old son,  Kian, who is so excited to learn about his world.</p>
            <p>I am a self-taught a software engineer for a small software company in Lehi, Utah.</p>
            <p>I'm coming up on my 6th year in the industry and I'm looking to fill in some gaps in my knowledge by pursuing an Applied Technology degree.</p>
            <p>I served in the Denmark, Copenhagen mission from 2011-2013, and loved my time there.</p>
            <p>I'm looking forward to getting to know everyone and learning all about HTML and CSS!</p>
